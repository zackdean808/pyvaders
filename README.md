Space Invaders is a classic arcade game from the 1980s. PyInvaders is an implementation of this in python

[Source wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Invaders)

> Within the shooter genre, Space Invaders was the first fixed shooter and set the template for the shoot 'em up genre. The goal is to defeat wave after wave of descending aliens with a horizontally moving laser to earn as many points as possible.

If the Alien touches the ship it's **GameOver**
